# To-Do List App

A simple and interactive To-Do List application built with **React.js**. This app helps users organize and prioritize their daily tasks by allowing them to add, delete, and mark tasks as complete.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks to their list.
- **Mark as Complete**: Users can mark tasks as completed, visually distinguishing them.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can remove tasks from the list once they're done or no longer needed.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is responsive and works seamlessly across different devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
